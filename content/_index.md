Hi there!

I'm Muuo, a (now former) Msc. student in UofT's Computer Science Department (2016-2018). I worked in the [Computational Linguistics](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/) group under [Frank Rudzicz](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frank) and [Graeme Hirst](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gh). While there, I got the chance to work on problems in Natural Language Understanding and Information Retrieval. I also had the honor of serving as Cookie Master for the [CSGBS](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/csgsbs/).

I currently work as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Yaar Inc](https://yaar.ai) where I build interactive dialogue systems and agents that navigate the web.

You can learn more about me in my [Résumé](/docs/cv_muuo.pdf).
