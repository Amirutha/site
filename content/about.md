Between 2016 and early 2018 I was a Msc. student in UofT's Computer Science Department. I worked in the Computational Linguistics group under [Frank Rudzicz](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frank) and [Graeme Hirst](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gh). While there, I got the chance to work on problems in Natural Language Understanding and Information Retrieval. I also had the honor of serving as Cookie Master for the [CSGBS](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/csgsbs/).

I currently work as a Machine Learning engineer at [Yaar Inc](https://yaar.ai) where I build interactive dialogue systems and use reinforcement learning to teach agents to navigate the web.
